# WhosWithMe

This is a site where people can post opinions or arguments and see whether or not the Internet agrees with them.
It was really just made to showcase the [Unlock authentication framework](https://www.unlock-app.com/).
It was made over the period of a couple days and incorporates authentication and account functionality without having
any sort of user data in the database. That's all handled by Unlock.
